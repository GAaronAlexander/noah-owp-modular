02/CO2: 
  partial pressures at interface (sfc) originate in tables, assigned to parameters 02, CO2
  O2/CO2 are local variables in the driver, converted to CO2PP/O2PP (forcings) before being used to call main SFLX routine in hrldas driver, 
  then internally energy as 02AIR, CO2AIR, which call before entering sflx:
       CO2PP  = CO2_TABLE * P_ML                      ! partial pressure co2 [Pa]
       O2PP   = O2_TABLE  * P_ML                      ! partial pressure  o2 [Pa]
       (P_ML can be substituted with 1-d pressure forcing (SFCPRS))

       P_ML   =(P8W3D(I,KTS+1,J)+P8W3D(I,KTS,J))*0.5  ! surface pressure defined at intermediate level [Pa]

       PSFC   = P8W3D(I,1,J)                          ! surface pressure defined a full levels [Pa]

P8W -- xyz input forcing, where z is 2 levels if coming from wrf.  often the avg of the two is calculated, as above for P_ML

     
TAH -- comes from TAHXY, read from T_PHY (3d variable) in readforc_hrldas, where it just takes the temperature forcing. 
       it's really the temperature above the canopy but could start with air temp
